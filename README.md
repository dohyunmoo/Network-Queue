# Network-Queue
Simulating message queues in routers and host-computers

Use rho values (with flag -r) to alter the number of packets arriving to the queue (default = 0.75).  
Change queue size (with flag -q) to implement maximum number of packets a queue can handle - excess packets arriving to the queue will be lost.  
Can increase the simulation time (with flag -T).
